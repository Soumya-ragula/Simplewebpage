    <h1>Welcome to My Styled Webpage</h1>

   
    <section id="section1">
        <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is the first section of the webpage. The background color here is a light red, which gives it a vibrant appearance. In this section, we introduce the main purpose of the webpage, explaining the use of CSS to style various HTML elements in a visually appealing way. This section is using a different text color for the paragraph, creating a clear contrast with the background.</p>
    </section>

    
    <section id="section2">
        <h2>Section 2: About CSS</h2>
        <p>This section has a calm, light blue background, which creates a soothing effect for the reader. In this section, we discuss how CSS helps to separate content from design, making web pages more flexible and easy to maintain. The text color remains consistent across all sections for readability, while the background color changes to keep each section visually distinct.</p>
    </section>

   
    <section id="section3">
        <h2>Section 3: More Information</h2>
        <p>The third section is styled with a light green background, representing growth and information. Here, we provide more details about the versatility of CSS. Using different background colors for sections helps to clearly define each part of the page while keeping the reader engaged.</p>
